## Introduction

TrinityCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit our site linked below or
make pull requests to our [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/trinitycore/TrinityCore_434/).

For further information on the TrinityCore project, please visit our project
website at [TrinityCore.org](https://www.trinitycore.org).
